# 3D Printed Collar

Hi! You can found here some .stl for 3d collars.
Unless otherwise specified, the internal diameter is 11 mm

## !!! Warning !!!
This project can use a shock collar - a device traditionally used in "training" dogs and pets. While I cannot stop you from using it for this purpose, I condemn in the strongest possible terms the use of shock collars, and by extension, the use of this project to adapt shock collars, that are used on any entity that can feel pain that is unable to (i.e. non-human animals, human children) or does not (i.e. unwilling adults) consent to it's use on them.

This project uses commercial products that are intended for use on non-human animals, and involve electricity. I offer no guarantee that use outside (or within) the manufacturers intended use are safe and I recommend you seek medical advice on the issue before use.
